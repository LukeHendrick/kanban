===================================

## Includes Express and Webpack

 
#### Leverages React-Bootstrap for styling

First things first:

```npm install```
  
Start in dev mode by using:   

```npm run dev```

Files will be served from ``localhost:8000``

***

Build for production with:

```npm run build```

and then start the express server with:

```node server.js```

Files will be served from ``localhost:3000``

***

Includes pre-built **ServiceWorker** and **Manifest**, you just need to include the proper icons and name them as shown in ```manifest.json```. Add your app's name to to ```manifest.json``` and **BAM** you've got yourself a progressive web app goin'.

Procfile is also included, for Heroku deployment.

Axios is included for api usage, but is not implemented at this time. Feel free to remove it.
