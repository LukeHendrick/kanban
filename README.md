Includes pre-built **ServiceWorker** and **Manifest**, you just need to include the proper icons and name them as shown in ```manifest.json```. Add your app's name to to ```manifest.json``` and **BAM** you've got yourself a progressive web app goin'.

Procfile is also included, for Heroku deployment.

Axios is included for api usage, but is not implemented at this time. Feel free to remove it.
